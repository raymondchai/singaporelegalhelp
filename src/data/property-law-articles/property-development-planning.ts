# Property Development and Planning Law in Singapore: URA Guidelines and Compliance

## Introduction

Property development and planning law in Singapore operates under a comprehensive regulatory framework designed to ensure orderly urban development, environmental sustainability, and public safety. The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) serves as the primary planning authority, working alongside other agencies to regulate land use, building development, and urban planning initiatives.
