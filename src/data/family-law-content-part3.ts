The key to successful marital agreements lies in proper preparation, full disclosure, independent legal advice, and fair terms that consider both parties' interests. These agreements should be viewed as part of comprehensive financial and estate planning rather than just divorce preparation.

  {
    category_id: familyLawDatabaseConfig.categoryId,
    user_id: null,
    question: "What are the grounds for divorce in Singapore?",
    answer: "Singapore recognizes only one ground for divorce: the irretrievable breakdown of marriage. This must be proven through one of five facts: (1) Adultery - your spouse committed adultery and you find it intolerable to live with them; (2) Unreasonable behaviour - your spouse behaved in a way that you cannot reasonably be expected to live with them; (3) Desertion - your spouse deserted you for at least 2 continuous years without consent; (4) Separation with consent - you've lived apart for at least 2 years and your spouse consents to divorce; (5) Separation without consent - you've lived apart for at least 4 years. The court requires evidence to support whichever ground you choose. It's important to note that Singapore follows a no-fault divorce system in practice, meaning the court focuses on whether the marriage has broken down rather than assigning blame.",

    question: "How long does a divorce take in Singapore?",
    answer: "The duration of divorce proceedings in Singapore varies significantly depending on whether the divorce is contested or uncontested. For uncontested divorces where both parties agree on all matters, the process typically takes 4-6 months from filing to Interim Judgment, plus an additional 3-6 months to resolve ancillary matters (custody, maintenance, asset division), totaling 7-12 months. Contested divorces take much longer, usually 12-24 months or more, depending on the complexity of issues and level of cooperation between parties. The mandatory counselling or mediation sessions can add 2-3 months to the timeline. Factors that can extend the process include incomplete documentation, complex asset structures, international elements, and court scheduling. The court aims to finalize most straightforward cases within reasonable timeframes, but parties should be prepared for potential delays.",

    question: "Can I get divorced if my spouse doesn't agree?",
    answer: "Yes, you can get divorced in Singapore even if your spouse doesn't agree, but the process will be more complex and time-consuming. This is called a contested divorce. You still need to prove one of the five grounds for irretrievable breakdown of marriage: adultery, unreasonable behaviour, desertion for 2+ years, separation for 2+ years (with consent), or separation for 4+ years (without consent). If your spouse contests the divorce, they can file a Defence within 14 days of being served. The case will then proceed to trial where you must present evidence to support your grounds. The court will make a decision based on the evidence presented. Even in contested cases, the court may order mediation or counselling to see if reconciliation is possible. While you cannot be forced to remain married against your will, contested divorces are more expensive, stressful, and time-consuming, often taking 12-24 months or longer to resolve.",

    question: "What happens to our HDB flat during divorce?",
    answer: "HDB flats are considered matrimonial assets and will be divided during divorce proceedings, even if only one spouse's name is on the title. The court will consider various factors including financial contributions, non-financial contributions (homemaking, childcare), and the needs of any children. Common outcomes include: (1) Transfer to one spouse who compensates the other for their share; (2) Sale of the flat with proceeds divided; (3) Deferred sale until children reach majority. The receiving spouse must meet HDB eligibility criteria including citizenship, income ceilings, and ethnic integration policy requirements. CPF monies used for the flat purchase must be refunded to the respective CPF accounts with accrued interest. If neither spouse can afford to keep the flat or meet eligibility criteria, it must be sold. The court prioritizes children's housing needs and may award the flat to the parent with care and control. Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty (ABSD) may apply depending on circumstances.",

    question: "How is child custody decided in Singapore?",
    answer: "Child custody in Singapore is decided based on the 'best interests of the child' principle, which is the paramount consideration. The court evaluates multiple factors including: the child's physical, emotional, and psychological welfare; the child's educational and developmental needs; stability and continuity of care; the child's own wishes (depending on age and maturity); each parent's capacity and commitment to parenting; financial ability to provide for the child; physical and mental health of parents; history of domestic violence or abuse; and the relationship between the child and each parent. Most custody arrangements in Singapore involve joint custody (both parents retain decision-making rights) with sole care and control to one parent (child lives primarily with one parent). The court encourages both parents to remain involved in the child's life unless there are safety concerns. Factors like gender of the parent or financial status alone do not determine custody. The court may order social welfare reports, child interviews, or appoint child representatives in complex cases.",

    question: "Do I need a lawyer for my divorce?",
    answer: "While you're not legally required to have a lawyer for divorce in Singapore, it's highly recommended, especially for contested divorces or cases involving significant assets, children, or complex issues. You can represent yourself (called 'acting in person'), but this is challenging given the complexity of family law, court procedures, and documentation requirements. A lawyer is essential if: your divorce is contested; there are significant assets to divide; child custody is disputed; domestic violence is involved; international elements exist; or your spouse has legal representation. For simple uncontested divorces with no children and minimal assets, some people do proceed without lawyers, but even then, legal advice for document preparation and understanding your rights is valuable. Legal aid is available for those who meet income criteria. The cost of legal representation (typically $3,000-$8,000 for uncontested, $15,000-$50,000+ for contested) should be weighed against the potential financial and emotional costs of mistakes or unfavorable outcomes.",

    question: "Can I claim maintenance from my ex-spouse?",
    answer: "Yes, you may be able to claim maintenance from your ex-spouse, but it's not automatic and depends on several factors. The court considers your financial needs and obligations, the standard of living during marriage, your age and health, earning capacity, contributions to the marriage, and your ex-spouse's ability to pay. Maintenance can be awarded as monthly payments, lump sum, or asset transfers. The amount typically ranges from 10-30% of the payer's income, adjusted for the recipient's own income and needs. Maintenance may be time-limited or indefinite depending on circumstances. Factors that strengthen your claim include: long marriage duration, limited earning capacity due to age/health/career sacrifice, significant non-financial contributions during marriage, and genuine financial need. Maintenance can be varied if circumstances change significantly (job loss, illness, remarriage). Note that maintenance is separate from child support, which both parents are obligated to provide regardless of custody arrangements. Consult a family lawyer to assess your specific situation and prospects for maintenance.",
