# ADR 0012: Document Builder Implementation

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The Singapore Legal Help platform needed a way for users to create legally compliant documents without requiring direct legal consultation for standard documents. Users needed Singapore-specific templates with proper validation and formatting for legal documents.

## Decision
We decided to implement a comprehensive Document Builder system with the following characteristics:
- Template-based document generation (DOCX and PDF formats)
- Singapore-specific validation (NRIC, UEN, phone formats)
- Variable-driven customization with reusable components
- Tiered access based on subscription levels
- Analytics tracking for template usage

## Consequences
### Positive
- Provides immediate value to users without requiring lawyer consultation
- Creates a revenue stream through premium templates
- Differentiates the platform from competitors
- Establishes foundation for future document automation features

### Negative
- Requires ongoing maintenance of templates for legal accuracy
- Increases complexity of the platform architecture
- Requires careful validation to ensure legal compliance
